__init__.py: This file is required to make Python treat the directory as a package. You don't need to put any code in it.
bot.py: This is where you define your main Bot class, which will handle all interactions with the Telegram API.
  You can put all the methods related to managing the bot itself, like starting and stopping the bot,
  setting up logging, and so on.
handlers/: This folder is where you put all your message and callback query handlers. 
  Each handler should be defined in its own file (e.g. message_handler.py and callback_query_handler.py). 
  You can use __init__.py to import all the handlers so they're accessible from other files.
models/: This folder is where you put all your data models (e.g. User and Chat). 
  Each model should be defined in its own file (e.g. user.py and chat.py). 
  Again, you can use __init__.py to import all the models so they're accessible from other files.
